      <description>Data Analytics in AccountingData analytics is important for accounting profession because data gathering and analytics technologies have the potential to fundamentally change accounting and auditing task processes (Schneider et al. 2015). Scholars note that the emergence of data analytics will significantly change the infer/predict/assure (e.g., insight/foresight/oversight) tasks performed by accountants and auditors. Big data and analytics have increasingly important implications for accounting and will provide the means to improve managerial accounting, financial accounting, and financial reporting practices (Warren Jr, Moffitt, and Byrnes 2015).</description>

      <description>CEO Network Centrality &amp;amp; Audit Timeliness The study examines the association between CEO’s network connections and audit timeliness. Based on extant research, we hypothesize that well-connected CEOs are associated with reduced audit lag. Using a sample of over 2000 firms for the period 2004 to 2017, we find that, ceteris paribus, firms with well-connected CEOs are associated with reduced audit lag. We also find firms led by more connected CEOs have better financial reporting quality and pay higher auditing fees for increased audit efforts.</description>
